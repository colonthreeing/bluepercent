# Blue%
---

This is a mod for Balatro to assist in Blue% runs.

### What's blue%?

TLDR: Blue jokers or cards that interact with clubs only, play all small blinds, skip all big blinds, use only clubs on high contrast.

### Why a mod?

It helps you keep track of what jokers are allowed and instantly loses the game if you violate a rule so you don't have to think about it.

This mod also includes some visual changes to be more blue. The extent of which is basically just changing most red -> blue in the UI.
